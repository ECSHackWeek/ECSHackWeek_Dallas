## Installation instructions

The below instructions are based on those for [software carpentry](http://installation.software-carpentry.org/) and the UW Software Development for Data Scientists [course](http://uwseds.github.io/software.html).
Software carpentry in particular is a great resource if you run into any trouble.

### Bash shell and git software version control

The bash shell provides a programming environment that is often used to manipulate files, install programs, and basic data analysis. 
The git version control system (along with the github website) are widely used for sharing codes and collaborative development of software.
Bash and git are part of Linux and Mac OSX. Windows users should install gitbash. (See https://git-scm.com/download/win.)

### Python

If you do not already have Python 3 installed on your computer (or even if you do, but don't use Conda), we recommend using installing miniconda.
Installation instructions for your OS can be found at https://conda.io/miniconda.html. 
After you have installed conda, run the following to install Jupyter notebooks:

1. Update condaâ€™s listing of packages for your system: `conda update conda`
2. Install Jupyter notebook and its requirements: `conda install notebook`

### Github account

Create an account at https://github.com/. A basic account is free (if you use your .edu email account, you can create 5 private repositories).

### (Optional) Text editor 

A text editor like [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) or [Atom](https://atom.io/) are great tools for data science and hacking.
