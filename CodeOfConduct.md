# Anti-harassment policy:
The Electrochemical Society (ECS) Data Science Hack Week is dedicated to providing a harassment-free learning experience for everyone regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks. Hack Week participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the Hack Week without a refund at the discretion of the organizers.

Harassment includes, but is not limited to:
-	Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion
-	Sexual images in public spaces
-	Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following
-	Sustained disruption of talks or other events
-	Inappropriate physical contact
-	Unwelcome sexual attention
-	Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organizers retain the right to take any actions to keep the event a welcoming environment for all participants. This includes warning the offender or expulsion from ECS Hack Week.

Event organizers may take action to redress anything designed to, or with the clear impact of, disrupting the event or making the environment hostile for any participants. We expect participants to follow these rules at all the event venues and event-related social activities.

Harassment and other code of conduct violations reduce the value of ECS Hack Week for everyone. If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it as soon as possible to one of the organizers. You can make a report either personally or anonymously. Anonymous reports can be made at https://ecshackweek.wufoo.com/forms/ecs-hack-week-code-of-conduct-violation/.


This anti-harassment policy is based on the example policy from the [Geek Feminism wiki](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Policy), created by the [Ada Initiative](https://adainitiative.org/) and other volunteers as well as the [Neurohackademy](https://neurohackweek.github.io/). The code of conduct is adopted from [Astrohackweek](http://astrohackweek.org/).
